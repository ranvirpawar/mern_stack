# Node

### How Web server Works

> in java the server can run upto 200 threads which is used to handle multiple requests and responses
> js does not have concept of threads 
> 1 Non Blocking I/O   2 Asynchronus 
> node is used for i/o intensive work not useful for cpu intensive work 
> node js is single threaded but behind the scene the kernel is using multiple threads
> fast and flexible

### NPM 

> Node has multiple inbuild modules ( http, FS(file system), cryptography )
 if you want to use someone else's module then we have concept of ***NPM***

#### NPM node package manager ####
> it has millions of packages ( 1 million above)
> you can also push your module into NPM
> NPM is part of GITHUB
> eg mongodb, socket.io, express 

##### modules #####
> collection of diff packages
> to used module use --> require ' '
> module should be exported before i.e module.exports.name = name
